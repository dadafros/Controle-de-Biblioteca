# Controle-de-Biblioteca
This is one of the projects developed by me and my teammate during the Object Oriented Programming Course at UFMG

In this work we create a set of classes for a library control system. The system should provide information about users, publications and loans.
The work involves the application of the knowledge acquired during the course, such as: composition, inheritance, polimorfism and virtual functions, downcasting and object slicing, overloads, exception handling and the use of reference variables, constants and etc.
